This project automates UI testing using Selenium and Pytest, including validation of "Veg/fruit name" column sorting on the Offers page.
It also performs end-to-end e-commerce flow testing: login, add product to cart, checkout, enter delivery address, and validate order success.
Test data is managed via a JSON file for multiple scenarios, and Chrome WebDriver is used for automation.
Designed to ensure both UI functionality and complete business workflows work as expected.
